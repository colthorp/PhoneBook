Algorithm's Assigment 


Project Diffuculties & Wins:

I started this assignemnt off with the Family Tree Assignment. That was the one I had the hardest time with, so i figured what better way to learn than by practicing. That only lasted so long before I felt defeated and decided to switch over to the PhoneBook. We had not only gone over the lesson, but also for the practice class, you went over a quick demonstration on how you would do it. I also knew I could add a HTML & CSS to this project to give myself the visual and help me understand better by seeing the functions in action rather than in a terminal - I hope this is okay.


CHALLENGES:
 - having to use a quicksort was the biggest challenge. I understand the idea of it and how it works, but as soon as it get into a more complicated examples I have a hard time. Everything on youtube also seems to cover only sorting numbers. I know it shouldn't make a difference as it's more about the array, but it's one I can't seem to wrap my had around, so i got some help on that one.
 - everything was working fine until i tried to import the sort.js file. As soon as I added it, the add, edit and delete functions wouldn't work
 - needing to add type='module' to my HTML script to was unexpected, but thank you to google I was able to figure that out.

WINS: 
- Having more confience in HTML & CSS was a win for me. Looking back to the first assignment, I love knowing that I have already learned so much more. I know that's not really the point of the assignment, but still a win to me.
- even though I didn't complete the Family Tree Project, I was still able to better understand trees
